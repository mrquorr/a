# AI-Assisted Coding Study Results

## Study Overview

This study examined the **impact of AI assistance** on coding performance across **14 participants** (IDs 300-313) who completed two rounds of coding challenges on **November 14, 2025**.

### Round 1: No AI Assistance
- **Average Success Rate**: 25%
- **Average Confidence Level**: 1.9/5

### Round 2: With AI Assistance  
- **Average Success Rate**: 89%
- **Average Confidence Level**: 4.6/5

## Key Findings

The results demonstrate a **compelling 64 percentage point improvement** in performance when AI assistance was available, accompanied by a **2.7-point increase** in participant confidence.

### What This Means
- **Enhanced Performance**: AI tools significantly improve objective coding outcomes
- **Increased Confidence**: Developers feel more capable and self-assured when using AI assistance
- **Dual Impact**: Both measurable performance AND subjective confidence improved substantially

## Data Access

**Complete Dataset**: The full dataset is available in [`experiment_results.csv`](./experiment_results.csv), containing detailed metrics for each participant including:
- Test results for both rounds
- Completion times
- Confidence scores
- Performance comparisons
